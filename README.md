## Known issues / fixes

This was built on Fedora 42 so you shouldn't need anything extra.

If you're running WireWarden on Debian 13, you may see a couple of minor
errors.\
They're easy to fix with the correct packages installed.

**"A terminal is required to read the password"**\
This appears when no graphical authentication agent is present.\
Install `pkexec`, the `polkit` daemon, and a desktop-specific agent:

``` bash
sudo apt install pkexec polkitd polkit-kde-agent-1
```

If you're using GNOME, use this instead:

``` bash
sudo apt install policykit-1-gnome
```

Then log out and back in (or reboot) so the agent starts properly.\
You'll now see a GUI password prompt when WireWarden needs elevated
access.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**"/usr/bin/wg-quick: line 32: resolvconf: command not found"**\
This occurs if your WireGuard config includes a `DNS=` line but the
system lacks a `resolvconf` provider.\
Install one of these packages to fix it:

``` bash
sudo apt install resolvconf
# or
sudo apt install openresolv
```

After installation, bring the interface back up and DNS will configure
correctly.
